"Contestant who earns a score equal to or greater than the k-th place finisher's score will advance to the next round, as long as the contestant earns a positive score..." — an excerpt from contest rules.

A total of n participants took part in the contest (n ≥ k), and you already know their scores. Calculate how many participants will advance to the next round.

Input
The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ k ≤ n ≤ 50) separated by a single space.

The second line contains n space-separated integers a1, a2, ..., an (0 ≤ ai ≤ 100), where ai is the score earned by the participant who got the i-th place. The given sequence is non-increasing (that is, for all i from 1 to n - 1 the following condition is fulfilled: ai ≥ ai + 1).

Output
Output the number of participants who advance to the next round.

My thoughts: Tracing from Kth index 

#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main(){
  int n,k;
  cin>>n>>k;
  int a[n];
  for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
      cin>>a[i];
  }
  int count=0;
  if(a[k]==0){
      for(int i=1;i<k;i++){
          if(a[i]>0){
              count++;
          }
      }
      cout<<count;
  }
  else{
  for(int i=k+1;i<=n;i++){
          if(a[i]>=a[k]){
              count++;
          }
      }
      cout<<count+k;
  }
  return 0;
}
